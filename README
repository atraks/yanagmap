Intro
=====
YaNagMap is a complete clone of Nagmap (https://github.com/hecko/nagmap) with rewritten api to use Yandex Maps. 

YaNagMap project is an initiative to create super-simple application to 
integrate Nagios with Yandex maps. The integration aims to visualize 
current status of network devices on aerial photography images. It 
also aims to give administrator basic information on devices to do 
further investigation of their status, such as links to MRTG and 
Smokeping pages of respected devices.

If you experience any problems deploying YaNagMap please 
send an email to atraks@gmail.com - I will do my best
to assist you or to add new features into YaNagMap. 

YaNagMap uses Yandex Map API v2.1
